Here I am using #BroadcastReceiver #NotificationManager #services. Service for holding the full download process, if the user leaves the app middle of the download it will continue in the background. 
BroadcastReceiver for taking updates on the download status and showing a notification when users are out of the app if they navigate to the app again he/she can see the current status of the download.

## Here I am using two URLs:
#first: http://dropbox.sandbox2000.com/intrvw/SampleVideo_1280x720_30mb.mp4

#second: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/videodownloader-2847e.appspot.com/o/demo.mp4?alt=media&token=09adc942-0e7f-43b9-a7c2-54251e8d3776
